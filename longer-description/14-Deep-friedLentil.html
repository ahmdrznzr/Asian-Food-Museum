    <p>Dahi Bhalla Chaat is not only a beloved street food but also a festive dish in Pakistan. Its popularity peaks during the holy month of Ramadan, where it’s often served at iftar, the meal to break the fast. Bhallas, which are soft dumplings made from
        urad dal (split black gram), are first soaked and then topped with thick, tangy yogurt. This yogurt layer is spiced with roasted cumin, red chili powder, and sometimes chaat masala, adding a punch of flavors to the dish. What truly elevates the
        Dahi Bhalla Chaat experience is the generous addition of chutneys, particularly sweet tamarind chutney and spicy green chutney, which give the dish its characteristic sweet, sour, and spicy notes. The dish is garnished with crispy sev(fried chickpea
        noodles) or crushed papdi(crispy dough wafers), along with chopped coriander leaves, pomegranate seeds, and sometimes a sprinkle of chaat masala.The variety of toppings adds a delightful contrast of textures, making the dish both crunchy and creamy.The
        interplay of flavors and textures makes Dahi Bhalla Chaat an irresistible snack or appetizer, often enjoyed on hot summer days for its cooling effect from the yogurt.Its versatility allows it to be tailored to personal taste preferences, making
        it a widely loved dish in Pakistani households.
