    Bastani Sonnati, meaning "traditional ice cream," is an iconic Iranian dessert that stands out for its distinctive flavors and textures. This ice cream is traditionally made with a base of milk or cream, to which saffron, rosewater, and vanilla are added,
    creating a uniquely aromatic and rich flavor profile. The inclusion of "sahlab," a thickening agent derived from orchid tubers, gives the ice cream a chewy texture, which is unlike the smoother, more aerated texture of Western-style ice creams. Chunks
    of pistachios are mixed in, adding a delightful crunch to each bite, and sometimes thin strips of frozen cream (known as kāshek) are swirled into the mixture for extra indulgence. Bastani Sonnati is often served between two thin wafers, making it
    a convenient handheld treat that offers both flavor and nostalgia.The saffron gives the ice cream its vibrant yellow color, while the rosewater lends a delicate floral fragrance that enhances the overall sensory experience.The addition of pistachios,
    a beloved ingredient in Persian sweets, provides both texture and a nutty contrast to the smoothness of the ice cream.Often enjoyed during celebrations, festivals, or simply on a hot summer day, Bastani Sonnati is more than just a dessert— it is a
    reminder of Iran’ s rich culinary heritage and its longstanding tradition of crafting luxurious, fragrant sweets.
