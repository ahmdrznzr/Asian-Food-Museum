    <p>Sour Soup Beef Slices, or 酸汤肥牛, is a dish that perfectly embodies the Guizhou region's love for sour and spicy flavors. The base of this dish is a tangy, fermented broth, which often includes pickled chilies or vegetables, tomatoes, and vinegar. The
        broth is brought to a boil, and thin slices of beef, known as 肥牛(fei niu), are quickly cooked in it.The beef is typically marbled and tender, thinly sliced to allow for quick cooking, ensuring it absorbs the broth’ s flavors while remaining soft
        and juicy.Aromatic ingredients like garlic, ginger, and scallions further elevate the taste, making every bite burst with flavor. The dish’ s sourness, which is its defining characteristic, comes from a combination of tomatoes, fermented pickles,
        and sometimes vinegar, creating a refreshing yet bold taste.The broth, besides being sour, is often infused with a layer of heat from chili peppers or chili oil, which is typical of Guizhou cuisine.This dynamic combination of flavors is what sets
        Sour Soup Beef Slices apart from other hotpot or broth - based dishes.It 's often served with fresh vegetables and mushrooms, added to the soup alongside the beef, making it not only a protein-rich meal but also a nutritious one. Diners can adjust
        the sourness and spiciness by adding extra vinegar or chili oil based on their preference, offering a customizable dining experience.
